<h2>FindX</h2>
<div class="bg">
    <p>FindX is an android application that once installed, runs as an invisible background service that can't be uninstalled by a normal user.If a thief steals the phone, it get's locked with a preset password and if an incorrent password is entered, the app automatically takes the thiefs photo and sends it to your mail, the photo is accompanied with the devices location and a log of all the activities being performed at that specific instance. When in panic mode, if the thief attempts shutting the phone off, the app creates a fake shutdown and activates location and turns on data in the background and with that, the phone can be easily tracked. Later versions of the app will be able to survive a factory reset.</p>
